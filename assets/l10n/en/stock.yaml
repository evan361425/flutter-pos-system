      When this quantity is used for an ingredient, the default ratio added to that ingredient.
      For example: if this quantity is "Large" and the default ratio is "1.5",
      and there's a product "Cheeseburger" with the ingredient "Cheese," which uses "2" units of cheese per burger,
      when adding this quantity, the quantity of "Cheese" will automatically be set to "3" (2 * 1.5).
      If set to "1," there's no effect.
      If set to "0," the ingredient won't be used.
