      Applied when this quantity is used for an ingredient.

      For example:
      if this quantity is "Large" and the default ratio is "1.5",
      and there's a product "Cheeseburger" with the ingredient "Cheese,"
      which uses "2" units of cheese per burger,
      when adding this quantity,
      the quantity of "Cheese" will automatically be set to "3" (2 * 1.5).

      If set to "1," there's no effect.

      If set to "0," the ingredient won't be used.
