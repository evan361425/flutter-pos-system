    title: Order Count
    description: |-
      The order count reflects the attractiveness of products to customers.
      It represents the demand for your products in the market and helps you understand which products or time periods are most popular.
      A high order count may indicate the success of your pricing strategy or marketing activities and is one of the indicators of business model effectiveness.
      However, it's essential to note that simply pursuing a high order count may overlook profitability.
  revenue:
    title: Revenue
    description: |-
      Revenue represents the total sales amount and is an indicator of business scale.
      High revenue may indicate that your products are popular and selling well, but revenue alone cannot reflect the sustainability and profitability of the business.
      Sometimes, to increase revenue, companies may adopt strategies such as price reductions, which may affect profitability.
  profit:
    title: Profit
    description: |-
      Profit is the balance after deducting operating costs from operating income and is crucial for the company's ongoing operations.
      Profit directly reflects operational efficiency and cost management capabilities.
      Unlike revenue, profit considers the business expenses, including raw material costs, labor, rent, etc.
      It's a more practical indicator that helps you evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of operations.
