    usingSmallMoney: Using smaller denominations to give change

      When giving change to customers, if the cashier doesn't have the appropriate denominations, this message will appear.

      For example, if the total is $65 and the customer pays $100, the change should be $35.
      If the cashier only has two $10 bills and more than three $5 bills, this message will appear.

      To avoid this prompt:
      • Go to the changer page and top up various denominations.
      • Go to the [settings page]({link}) to disable related prompts from the cashier.
