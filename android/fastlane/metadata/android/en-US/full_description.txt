Order and Checkout System
This is an offline point-of-sale (POS) system that uses local files as its database.
This allows users to operate the system without an internet connection, and it not only stores order data but also allows for the configuration of inventory management and other functions.
This system is completely open source (free). If you are a programmer or anyone who wants to make this product better, you are welcome to visit the relevant website:
