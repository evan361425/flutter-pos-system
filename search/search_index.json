This minimizes the need for platform-specific interfaces, allowing a unified interface across multiple platforms.</p> <p>Of course, in certain scenarios, specific platform configurations are required. For example, iOS notifications need to be set up in XCode and AppStoreConnect.

Dart's style is similar to many object-oriented languages. Personally, I find it no different from other languages, mainly because it integrates well with IDEs, making it convenient to write. The documentation is also extensive. Here are a few detailed articles worth reading:</p> <ul> <li>10 good reasons why you should learn Dart</li> <li>Why Flutter uses Dart</li> </ul> <p>If you want to try it out right away, you can play with their online compiler.</p>"},{"location":"about/structure/#pos-system-architecture-on-flutter","title":"POS System Architecture on Flutter","text":"<p>This aims to help beginners understand the app architecture.</p>"},{"location":"about/structure/#main-architecture","title":"Main Architecture","text":"<pre><code>.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 assets/             -
